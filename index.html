      <h3>Jos Jence</h3>
      <p> Hello, my name is Jos and this is the project I made after two weeks of bootcamp. 
	I did computer science for A level where I was able to learn Python and Tkinter to make graphics.
	This is the first time I am learning Java and it was a great experience.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Football Target Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of methods, loops, and randomness. Firstly I used different shapes to 
	create the football pitch, stands, goal and the ball itself.Then I created three
	targets contained in a method which I called multiple times. Next, I intoduced
	movement to the ball using the position of the mouse and used an if statement to
	see if the ball hits the target in which case the score increments by one. 
	To have an end to the game, I made a timer which gives you ten seconds to get as
	many points as you can, after which the game is over. Finally, I used a for loop
	to draw people in the stands with their bodies changing colour for extra effect.
